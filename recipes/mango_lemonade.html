      A mango lemonade recipe you'll fall in love with! The perfect drink when
      it's hot outside. Many of us don't want to fuss with making elaborate
      recipes so it's been my goal to come up with simple and fast recipes that
      are both beautiful and delicious. This is why I love this mango lemonade
      so much.
